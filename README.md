# README Generator, using Node.js

## Desription

This application's purpose is to ease the process of creating a README.md file. Instead of writing every bit of code in the README.md file, this application allows the user to input text they'd like within labeled sections, and an organized file including a license badge and table of contents is produced in their working directory. 

This project did a great job of rounding out a basic understanding of Node.js, and how it can be used to make software developement a bit more streamlined. In addition to this, creation of all needed functions deepened understanding of computational thinking and template literals.

## Installation

User must ensure they have Node.js installed on their machine before use.

## Usage

As a user of this application, I am working on a coding project and want to quickly build a very professional README.md file. When I run this application in the terminal, I am prompted a series of questions about my project. When I am done answering these questions I see that a new README.md file is created within my working directory. This file is well structured, with clearly labeled sections, and containing all the information I input for the questions.
