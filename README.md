# Professional README Generator, Using Node.js

## Description

This README generator is a command-line application built with node.js that simplifies the process of creating a professional, accessible, and well-structured README file. The user will be prompted a set of questions about their project, and these answers will then be used to write a README mardown file. This file will be immediatly accessible to the user within the directory.

## Installation 

This README generator does require Node.js be installed on your machine. Please ensure this is done before running application.

## Usage

As a user of this application, I have just finished a project and am now seeking to complete a professional and organized README.md file. After ensuring my computer has Node.js installed, I run this program and am prompted a series of questions. After answering these questions I see that a new file has appeared in my working directory, containing my responses within organized sections. I am also able to see at the top of this file what kind of license I have chosen, if I have chosen one.
